# Python_Persian_Crawler
In this Hands-On Tutorial, you will:
- Learn Web Scraping with Python. 
- Get familiar with Web Scraping libraries that are used often.
- Crawl Persian websites. 
(This works only if you are using an Iranian IP.)

There are some minor Formatting issues when looking at the code on Github. But opening it with Jupyter or a similar IDE fixes it.
